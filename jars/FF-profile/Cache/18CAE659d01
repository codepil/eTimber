Test 296 - Websphere MQ Solution Design 
</h2><p>
pintux<br>Hi,<p>1. I have been looking for some guidance as to what material to use in preparing for the Websphere MQ Solution design certification?   I have looked at the Intercommunications manual, first couple of chapters for Clusters and MQ introduction and Administration.  Any other suggestions will be useful.<p>2. Are there any free mock exams on the net for this certification.<br />Thanks.

asifakamal3<br>This is not an entry level exam like Test 294. Many questions are practical in nature and you need working experience of atleast 2 years in MQ Admin/Development. I appeared for Test 296 and 297 in July 2003. Passed the 297 but failed in 296 by 1 point. I am preparing again to attend this month.<p>Following is a list which I think would be useful.<br />1. InterCommunication<br />Part1, Part2(Chap 4 is MOST IMP), Chapter 46 and Chapter 48 <p>2.Application Programming Guide<br />Part1 - Most imp<br />Part2 - Must read once<br />Part3 - Overall compilation and Major differences in building on various platforms <p>3.Security<br />Part1 , Part2, skim through 11-15 , chap 15<p>4. Clusters<br />chap 1,2,4,5,7-9 Overall understanding of chap 10-12<p>5. Clients<br />Chapter1 and Part3<p>6. System Admin Guide<br />Part5, Part7 ( Chapter 21 and 23 are most imp in part7)<br />See the Red Book "MQSeries Backup and Recovery" for Part5.<p>7. Using Java<br />Overall understanding of how Java applications are written for MQ, difference between client and binding and JMS programs. Dont have to be detailed, but overview is required.<p>8.Programmable Command Formats and Administration Interface<br />INtroduction, Using and Definations<p>9. Event MOnitoring<br />Chapter 1-2, Skim through others<p>10.WebSphere MQ for z/OSConcepts and Planning Guide<br />Part1 and Part2 are must, others are recommended.( chapter 2,4 and 6 are most imp )<p><br />Check <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/integration/support/supportpacs/category.html#cat1" target="_blank">IBM Support Packs</a> for following<br />MD00 : MQSeries - Creating design standards for applications<br />MD01 : MQSeries - Standards and conventions<br />MD05 : MQSeries - Design considerations for large Clusters<br />MC07 : MQSeries link for R/3 - Configuration guide<br />MD08 : WebSphere MQ - Network Design Notation<br />MC6C : WebSphere MQ - How to Configure SSL<br />MS81 : IPT<p>Eventhough the list seems to be long, but this is the minimum I could make for 296. If you have worked, you will pass through many of these quickly.<p>I have a PDF from IBM MQseries Techincal Conference, but I cant find the URL for that. I am pasting the text below with some questions. NOte that it was for Test096 ( predecessor of 296 in previous version).

<p><hr>
pintux<br>Thanks - these tips are very useful.  I had missed some of the recommended reading.  The questions seem to be very similar to the practice test for Test296. <p>Cheers,<br />Satinder
